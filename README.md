# MoveSlider

I created a simple game using SwiftUI and followed MVVM architectural pattern. 
In this project, I utilized property wrappers like @StateObject, @ObservedObject, @Published and @Binding. I used SwiftUI elements such as Button, Alert and Text.
I also gained experience in integration UIKit elements into SwiftUI project. SliderView created using UISlider from UIKit framework and UIViewRepresentable protocol.
